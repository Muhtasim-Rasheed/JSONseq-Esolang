# JSONseq

JSONseq is an esolang where instructions are, well, JSON objects. Wiki: https://esolangs.org/wiki/JSONseq

## Running
First, install Node.js. Then type the following commands:

```
$ node ./path/to/index.js ./path/to/program.json
```

You want a sorter command?

```
$ npm i pkg -g
$ pkg ./path/to/index.js
```

And there you have it, 3 executables. Select the one that corresponds to your operating system and rename  
it to something like "JSONseq" and then to run your program:

```
$ ./path/to/JSONseq ./path/to/index.js
```
